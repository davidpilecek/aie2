test files can be disregared, they're only for testing
for the use of the raspberry pi camera module, the picamera2 package is required. Because it works differently than the usual Videocapture method of OpenCV, the files are split into ones that work with the RPi camera (picam suffix) and ones that work with a regular USB Webcam (this was used for initial testing, as it was more convenient)
