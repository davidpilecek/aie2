test files can be disregared, they're only for testing

for the use of the raspberry pi camera module, the picamera2 package is required. Because it works differently than the usual Videocapture method of OpenCV, some files are split into ones that work with the RPi camera and ones that work with a regular USB Webcam (webcam suffix)... this was used for initial testing, as it was more convenient
